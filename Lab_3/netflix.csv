**The Story:**¬†

When a peaceful settlement on a moon in the furthest reaches of the universe finds itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius, Kora (**Sofia Boutella**), a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival.¬†

Tasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Motherworld, Kora assembles a small band of warriors ‚Äî outsiders, insurgents, peasants and orphans of war from different worlds who share a common need for redemption and revenge.¬†

As the shadow of an entire Realm bears down on the unlikeliest of moons, a new army of heroes is formed.

AMA!",929,2023-10-05 21:20:01+00:00,"PROOF: [https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fypbh72cp6gsb1.png](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fypbh72cp6gsb1.png)

I am a huge anime/manga fan, storyteller, and collaborator. My previous work on numerous shows such as THE DEFENDERS, LUKE CAGE, and AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. has led me to manifest my dream of sharing my favorite manga with the world. Bringing ONE PIECE to life has been an incredible experience for me and my team, and we're not done yet! So on October 6, I will be answering any and all questions. Ask away!

OK NAKAMA! I've gotta get back to actually making the show now. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! The positive reception to season 1 has been beyond anything I could have imagined. I appreciate all of you and your questions, your critiques, your thoughts, and your enthusiasm. We're hard at work on season 2 and in the meantime maybe watch season 1 a couple million more times. Thank you all! - Matt D Owens",https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/170tpsx/yo_im_matt_owens_coshowrunner_writer_and/
